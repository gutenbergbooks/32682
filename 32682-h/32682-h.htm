<h2>ABSURD TO A DEGREE.</h2>

<p>Now that girls have proved themselves capable of earning the highest
University honours, why should women remain debarred of University
degrees? If any senatorial difficulty precludes the removal of that
ridiculous injustice, a girl forbidden to term herself a Bachelor of
Arts, for example, might, it has been suggested, "invent some other
title more significant of the distinction she has won." No invention
could be easier. Her alternative for Bachelor would be obviously
Spinster of Arts. No Graduate able to pass the <i>Pons Asinorum</i> can be
such a preposterous donkey as to persist in denying even the
plainest&mdash;possibly the prettiest&mdash;Passwoman that. The Dons will be
unworthy of the name they go by unless they immediately remove the
disability their old-world statutes have imposed upon the <i>Donne</i>.</p>

<h2>ROBERT AT THE ACADEMY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I paid</span> my reglar wisit to the Academy last week, and was glad to find
that my werry ernest remonstrance of last year had perduced sech a
change as regards Staggerers. No Miss Menads a hunting in Burnham
Beeches without no close on to speak of, and no Mr. Cassandra a carrying
off of a pore yung lady afore she's had time to dress, merely because
she upset the salad-bowl.</p>

<p>I don't think it's because "familyaryty breeds content," as the poet
says, that I am less staggered than last year, but becos there ain't so
many staggerers to be staggered at. Not that there ain't none. Why,
there's one lady in the werry same dishabil as Madame Wenus herself a
poring out somethink that the Catalog says is a incantashun, but then
her pecooliar costoom is reelly xcusable, for she's that red hot that
wood excuse anythink or nothink, as in her case.</p>

<p>One of the jolliest picturs to my mind is a portrate of a Port Wine
drinker. Why, it seems to be a oozing out of ewery pore of his skin! and
nothink younger than '63, I'll be bound. What a life to lead, and what a
life to look back upon with proud satisfacshun!</p>

<p>Poor Lord <span class="smcap">Hartington</span> looks terribly bored at having to be gazed at so
constantly by so many longing, if not loving, eyes, and at being pinted
at by the old dowagers as their bo ideall of a sun in law.</p>

<p>Ah, Mr. <span class="smcap">Story</span> tells us a story as I've offen witnessed, when a young
swell stands treat to a few frends and then ain't got enuff money to pay
the bill! Wot a nuisance for him, but still wuss for the Landlord, and
wussest of all for the pore Waiter. Poor Mr. <span class="smcap">Grossmith</span> looks werry much
paler than when I saw him after a jolly dinner at the Mettropole. I
thinks as a glass or two of old Port would do him all the good in the
world.</p>

<p>I now come to another staggerer, that fairly puzzles me. It's a nice
young Lady, named, as I see by the Catalog, Euridice, which I beleeve is
Greek for "You're a nice one!" who is a trying for to pull a rock down,
but I'm sure she'll never do it, though she has taken off ewery morsel
of her close, ewen down to her stockings, to give her more strength. I
really wonders as she doesn't put a few of her things on, as she must
see as Mr. <span class="smcap">Hades</span> is a cumming towards her, and won't he jest be shocked!
And then here's another young Lady, almost as lightly drest, a sitting
quietly on a large cold stone, as if there wasn't no North-East wind a
blowing, and by moonlight too. What time can she expect to git home, and
what will her poor Mother say when she sees her?</p>

<p>If I'd ha' bin Mr. <span class="smcap">Hayne</span>, Esq., M.P., I'd ha bort a new Hat afore I was
painted for my pictur, and ewen gone to the xpense of a new pair of
gloves, speshally as his pictur is a going to be given to sumbody. So
now he'll go down to remote posteriority with a shabby Hat, and a old
pair of gloves on his table. His new Coat looks butifool. It is, I'm
told, a capital likeness.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> is placed in his proper persition as first in the best
room, and looks as happy and as jolly as I've no dout he ginerally
feels, though he don't never seem to git no rest.</p>

<p>In the next rooms its the great Cardinal <span class="smcap">Manning</span>, who ewerybody loves
and respects, Waiters and all, though it does rather try our loyalty to
see him at dinner, when he don't eat enuff wittles to fatten a church
mouse. If I'd ha' bin Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Watkin</span>, the grate Railway King, I'd ha
had a much cleaner shave afore I set for my pictur than he had. I know
as he doesn't like to be thought a close shaver in gineral, but, in this
werry partickler case, he might have made a xcepshun to his gineral
rule.</p>

<p>There's a lovely pictur called Ambrosia, a ewident misprint for
Hambrosia&mdash;probably a new kind of sandwitch&mdash;in which there's a werry
model of a good-looking waitress a carrying such a elegant little
lunshon, as reelly made me quite hungry to look at. I thinks as the reel
natives is quite a triumph of Hart. There's quite a grand pictur of the
dear old Bank, with all the Carts and Cabs and Omnibuses, and people
being all scrowged up together, just like life, and ewerybody a
wondering how on earth they shall hever be able to cross, jest like
life, and the Bus Coachman a flirtin with the lady passenger on the box,
jest like life, and the Policeman a driving away the pore little beggar,
jest like life. Ah, it's a reel lovely pictur that is, and werry
creditabel to Mr. <span class="smcap">Dogstail</span> who I'm told painted it.</p>

<p>I think the most perthetic pictur in the hole lot is the one called "the
Dunce." He's a setting all by hisself, pore feller, what they calls
detained, a trying his werry best to do his lesson and he can't do it.
And why, coz his thoughts is away out in the playground, where he hears
the shouts and the larfing of his skool-fellers. Now, what shood I do,
Doctor <span class="smcap">Abbott</span>, if I was his master? Why I shood let him have a nours run
with his playmates, and then, when he cums in fresh and jolly, try him
again, and praps he'd estonish you. I was a Dunce myself wunce,
spechally at spelling, and that's how <i>I</i> was cured.</p>

<p>How werry contented all the Parsons looks, they lolls back in their
cumferal chairs as much as to say to the tired wisitors, "Don't you wish
you had sitch chairs as these to set in?" Some of the Solgers looks at
you jest as if they'd like to say, "What on airth are you staring at?"</p>

<p>I coud ony take jest a glance at the lovely landscapes; but oh, how nice
and cool and carm they all looked, after the staring portrates with
their flaring cullers.</p>

<h2>MIXED PICKLES; OR, A VERY LATE PARTY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Private Room. Two Eminent Statesmen discovered in
consultation. Lists of past and present Members of Parliament, also
political Maps of England, scattered about.</i></p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll.</i> Well, we're agreed about the name, then. It's to be
the "National Radical Conservative Unionist Liberal Party," eh?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (doubtfully).</i> Rather long, isn't it? Wouldn't the "Old
England Party"&mdash;no connection with <span class="smcap">Dizzy's</span> "Young England" ditto&mdash;sound
better? And then we're safe to be called "Nationalists," and the word
has such disagreeable associations.</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (cheerfully).</i> Pooh! What's in a name? I've been
called lots of nasty ones before now.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n.</i> Yes, and called them yourself, too, sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (with gay indifference).</i> Now to business. The most
important thing we have to decide is&mdash;Who are to be the members of the
New Party?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (confidently).</i> Quite so. There'll be a perfect rush to
join us. We shall have to "hold the fort" pretty strongly to prevent our
being swamped. Mind, no weak compliance with what are called "social
influences."</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll.</i> No. And no claim for admission founded on mere
relationship to be regarded for a moment.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n.</i> Hm! I don't know. Family life, you see, is, after all,
the basis of the State; and so it's only fair that the State should do
something for one's family in return.</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (diplomatically).</i> All right! Then we'll shelve that
subject. Now, as regards the G. O. M. Suppose he found himself quite out
in the cold, and wanted to join us, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (decidedly).</i> Not for a moment. Where would our "Dual
Control" be then?</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll.</i> Of course. Shouldn't we let in <span class="smcap">Hartington</span>? Yes.
Well, how about <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n.</i> Awkward if <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span> thinks of becoming member of New
Party, eh?</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (energetically).</i> That's my view entirely. You see,
if <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span> joins, he'll want to be Prime Minister, and then where
should I be?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (surprised).</i> You! The question rather is, where I
should be?</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (hastily).</i> Ah, well; then we'll shelve <i>that</i>
subject too for the present. Wouldn't you&mdash;er&mdash;like&mdash;er&mdash;to go into the
Lords, and lead <i>them</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n.</i> You mean, of course, as Premier?</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (modestly).</i> I thought&mdash;ahem&mdash;that <i>my</i> natural
qualifications for that post were so obvious that&mdash;&mdash;but, as I said,
let's drop the subject for a time. We can come back to it again. Now,
what's to be the programme of the Party?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (with emphasis).</i> There's no doubt about <i>that</i>, I
should think. Free Education, of course. Then <span class="smcap">Jesse</span> insists on
allotments and free holdings&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (thoughtlessly).</i> Hang <span class="smcap">Jesse</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (with considerable dignity).</i> Hang him? I intend <span class="smcap">Jesse</span>
as our first Chancellor of the Exchequer, or President of Board of
Trade, I can tell you.</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (gaily).</i> All right. I don't mind, if you consent to
<span class="smcap">Wolff</span> being next Governor-General of India. Army and Navy Estimates to
be cut down Five Millions, each, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n.</i> Couldn't think of it. We must have a Fleet of some
sort, you know.</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (discontentedly).</i> Then <i>that</i> subject will have to
be shelved, too, I suppose. You don't mind, at any rate, a clean sweep
being made of the present Admiralty and Ordnance officials, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (heartily).</i> Not a bit. No broom you can use will be too
hard for them. They'll make it a dirty sweep before you've done. Then
there's Local Government, of course.</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll.</i> Readjustment of Taxation.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n.</i> Disestablishm&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll.</i> Eh? what?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (calmly).</i> Don't be alarmed. We'll shelve <i>that</i> too, if
you like.</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (relieved).</i> By all means. (<i>With growing
uneasiness.</i>) But then, I say, after all, what is our programme? How
does it differ from <span class="smcap">Salisbury's</span>, for instance?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (ingeniously).</i> Oh, it's far more really Conservative
than his, you know.</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll.</i> Yes&mdash;(<i>encouraged</i>)&mdash;- I see. Of course it is. And
how does it differ from <span class="smcap">Gladstone's</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n.</i> <span class="smcap">Gladstone's</span>? Oh, well&mdash;er&mdash;it's more <i>really and truly
Liberal</i> than his!</p>

<p><i>Lord R. Ch-rch-ll (ruminating).</i> That <i>sounds</i> all right. The question
is, will the country believe it? And if we have to shelve so many
questions in order to form our new National Party, shan't we run a risk
of being shelved ourselves when the next "wave of progress" sweeps over
the Constituencies? [<i>Left ruminating.</i></p>

<h2>WORTH MENTIONING.</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Westgate-On-Sea.</span>" <i>Mr. Punch</i> takes off his coat and westgate in this
hot weather to correct a slight misquotation. <i>Mr. Punch</i> is represented
as saying that none of the greatest Composers ever produced an air to
equal "the exhilarating, recuperating air" of Westgate-on-Sea. Now <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, when he wrote this (July 2), did not limit this lovely air to
one particular spot, but described it as "the exhilarating, recuperating
air of the Isle of Thanet." That Westgate is in Thanet is true, but the
advertiser poetically uses the part for the whole, thereby omitting
Birchington, Margate, Broadstairs, not to mention the inland villages
(delightful in the fall of the year), and above all Ramsgate, which is
not <i>Mr. Punch's</i> "seaside resort," as is Westgate when he wants a
northerly breeze, but <i>Mr. Punch's</i> seaside Residence, where
ten-twelfths of the year are delightful, where sky and sea come out in
Mediterranean colour,&mdash;where it is Nice without its cold-catching
dangers, where fruit and vegetables are flavoursome and plentiful, and
where there is even more than a fair share of that exhilarating,
recuperating air, of which the Isle of Thanet has the sole patent.</p>

<p>In one hour and forty minutes, the L. C. &amp; D. takes the traveller from
Town to Westgate, and in two hours to Ramsgate, by Granville Express
from Victoria and Holborn Viaduct. On Sunday morning, starting at 10&middot;30
A.M., the Jaded One can be down for lunch at Ramsgate by 12&middot;30, and all
the day before him.</p>

<p><i>&Agrave; propos</i> of the Granville Express, <i>Mr. Punch</i> had the pleasure of
dining at the Granville Hotel the other evening, and a better dinner,
better chosen, cooked, and served, could not be got anywhere in London,
or out of it. The proprietor, Mr. <span class="smcap">Quatermain East</span>, may not wish this to
be generally known, but <i>Mr. Punch</i>, who specially compliments the
<i>chef</i> on his clear turtle and whitebait, thinks that he shall be doing
a service to everybody by not keeping secret the story of this
<span class="smcap">Quatermain</span>&mdash;not Mr. <span class="smcap">Rider Haggard's</span> "<i>Allan</i>,"&mdash;who means to remain the
"Q in the corner" of the Isle of Thanet. "Q. E. D." and "D" stands for
"Dinner."</p>

<h4>Embodiment of an Arthurian legend. The Master of the
Revels.</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Times</i> of Thursday last in a learned article on the Gray's Inn
Masque, records that "On the 28th February 1587, eight members of the
Society were engaged in the production of <i>The Misfortunes of Arthur</i>"
but on the occasion of <i>The Maske of Flowers</i> in 1887, the Honourable
Society of Gray's Inn showed what could be done with the <i>Success of
Arthur</i>; that is, of Master <span class="smcap">Arthur W. &agrave; Beckett</span>, Master of the Revels.
And indeed what could be done in Old Gray's Inn, was on that occasion
quite a Revel-ation to most of us. <i>Mr. Punch</i> heartily congratulates
the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn on possessing such a
Revel-Master&mdash;he ought at once to be created Lord Revel-stoker&mdash;who is
able to give life and form to so excellent an idea, who can design such
exquisite costumes, compose such appropriate music, paint such perfect
scenery, and instruct amateur pupils in the arts of elocution, action,
singing and dancing.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> is perfectly aware that the costumes were due to Mr. <span class="smcap">Lewis
Wingfield's</span> designs and Mr. <span class="smcap">Alias's</span> workmanship, that the scenery was
painted by the old stager <span class="smcap">John O'Connor</span>, that the music was composed and
arranged by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Prendergast</span> and <span class="smcap">Birch-Reynardson</span>, and that the
dances were invented "with the assistance of MSS." (old English for
"Master of the SeremonieS") and taught by the experienced Mr. <span class="smcap">D'Auban</span>.
But the lawyers of Gray's well know that "<i>Qui facit per alium facit per
se</i>,"&mdash;and in the case of the costumes, <i>Qui facit per</i> <span class="smcap">Alias</span> <i>facit per
se</i>&mdash;and so with the merit of what Master <span class="smcap">Arthur W. &agrave; Beckett</span> executes
by his chosen agents he himself is to be credited. It was a great
success, from first to last. Just one word at parting. <i>Mr. Punch</i> hopes
that the <i>Maske</i>, as it is, is <i>not</i> to be reproduced on the public
stage. Such a proceeding, by depriving it of its venerable and
appropriate surroundings, would vulgarise an entertainment which should
have remained, within the precincts of Gray's Inn, archaic and unique.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>In Gray's Inn Hall.</i>&mdash;<i>Notes by a Very Ordinary Person.</i>&mdash;Crushed.
Difficulty with hat. That's why I dislike a <i>Matin&eacute;e</i>, because you can't
come in a crush hat. But you're sure to go away in a crush hat.
Opera-hat in daytime looks so disreputable: suggestive of having been
out all night. While hiding my hat, lost my book. Probably under lady's
dress. No use trying for it. Band outside plays National Anthem, and a
voice from a dark recess shouts out some word of command to the
Beefeaters&mdash;(poor chaps, in this hot weather "the
Overdone-Beefeaters"&mdash;fine-looking fellows with prime joints)&mdash;and then
enter Royalties. Can't see them. They're seated. Enter, in front, tall
young men in coloured tunics, knicker-bockers, and turn-down collars.
What are these? The Backward Pupils of Gray's Inn? No. The Orchestra. It
commences. There are fiddles, and basses, and a second-hand cracked
piano, suggestive of having been hired from itinerant Minstrels on
Margate Sands. My neighbour asks me if the band is "<span class="smcap">Coote</span> and <span class="smcap">Tinney</span>?"
My reply is evident&mdash;"More Tinny than Coot." Neighbour informs me that
the cracked piano is really a very old instrument, in use about the time
of Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. Exactly: just what I should have thought. The
Benchers ought to have been rich enough by now to have bought a new one.
When a thing is to be done, do it well. No cracked pianos. Not worth
fourpence an hour.</p>

<p>Curtain up. Low arch representing entrance to Old Gray's Inn. Enter a
Giant with a long white beard. I think he is Great Grandfather Christmas
off Gog and Magog's twelfth-cake. He solemnly salutes the audience in
military style. Why military? It suddenly occurs to me, "Is a Masque
funny?" I ask my neighbour. He is uncertain. Evidently a cautious man;
he will reserve his reply till he has seen it. Enter a Columbine, like
"My Lady" used to be on a May Day. She talks to Great Grandfather
Christmas, who seems frightened, and tries to back out of it. At present
I don't quite catch the plot. Next neighbour says he doesn't think there
is a plot. I ask him to look at his book. He says he is looking at it;
but it's printed in some dialect he doesn't understand. Enter another
Giant, dressed as a Jester. It appears that Great Grandfather Christmas
has forgotten his part, or left it in the dressing-room, and the Giant
Jester has kindly brought it him. No jokes as yet. No good lines. My
neighbour says this is the sort of thing Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> liked. Did she!
And the cracked piano, too, for music, which, on the exit of the Giants
and the Columbine, comes out as strong as the poor old thing can when
supported by violins and violoncellos.</p>

<p>Enter "<i>Silenus</i> and his Crew." I hear some one say this. Not a bit like
a crew. Not a sailor among them. Perhaps as this is a Mask, they are
sailors in disguise. <i>Silenus</i> is, of course, supposed to be
intoxicated. If he is intended to represent an ugly old man, dismally
drunk, and making painful efforts to catch a note, he succeeds, to the
life. Not funny, but clever. Splendid pantomimic property in the shape
of a gigantic tobacco-pipe, carried by an Indian. My neighbour says,
"Old <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> would have liked all this sort of thing." Poor dear! I
pity her, I ask if Indian is to be taken as an advertisement for the
Wild West? Neighbour replies, hesitatingly, that he knows the book has
been altered from what it was three hundred years ago to suit the
present time, so that perhaps I may be right. The cracked piano, which
is having a hard day of it, breaks out into a lively measure. <span class="smcap">Red Shirt,
Silenus</span>, "and his crew" join in a dance, "<i>Crew Junction</i>"&mdash;but why not
a hornpipe, if they're a crew?&mdash;and the Curtain descends on Part the
First.</p>

<h4>Limbs of the Law.</h4>
</div>

<p><i>Part the Second.</i>&mdash;Young Elizabethan Maidens in front of a bank of
roses, and a fountain lighted up, as is the garden, with variegated
lamps. "Figures look like Old Chelsea," my neighbour says. I return
(because the variegated lamps and the illuminated fountains and the
arbours appeal to bye-gone memories),&mdash;"Old Chelsea? Yes&mdash;Cremorne."
Then the Maidens sing a dirge. Perhaps mourning, or Cre-morning, for the
departure of lost glories. Then they open out gracefully, and discover
the Columbine of Part the First with a lot of young men&mdash;(Oh!),&mdash;all
seated together in the basin of the fountain. The young men in
masks&mdash;(Aha!&mdash;now I see why this is called a Masque!&mdash;Now I am happy,
whether Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> would have liked it or not!)&mdash;come out of the
fountain, quite dry, rather unpolitely leaving poor Columbine still in
the basin under the dripping water. Maids of the Inn can and do sing
charmingly. The Masquers can and do dance. Plot no object. It's all
elegant and graceful, but distinctly sad, as how can it be anything else
to the accompaniment of that cracked piano, whose temporary absence must
deprive Margate Sands of much harmless enjoyment. "They haven't smiled
once," I say to my neighbour. "No more have I," he replies crustily, but
then explains that Queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> didn't like smiling unless she smiled
first. The Masquing men are most anxious and attentive to their steps;
the Ladies all delightful. Great applause. Encores. And during all this,
the unfortunate Columbine remains sitting in the basin, with her feet in
cold water, and her head apparently under a dripping <i>douche</i>. She must
be of a most contented disposition, as whenever I catch sight of her she
is smiling, somewhat vapidly it is true, but still smiling, and beating
time on her knees, perhaps to keep herself as warm as possible in such a
peculiarly damp situation.</p>

<p>The end is approaching: for the first time I notice some of the bolder
Revellers begin to smile. At length re-enter the Giants, Great
Grandfather Christmas &amp; Co., and the Indians. They rescue Columbine from
the fountain. Now I think I see the plot. I mention this to neighbour,
triumphantly; but he says I mustn't talk while Royalty is leaving, as
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> wouldn't like it. So we join in "<i>God Save the Queen</i>!" and
it's all over. <i>Exeunt omnes.</i> Must get a book.</p>

<h2>MORE JILLS IN OFFICE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Postal Counter of Shop in another part of Town.</i> <i>Two more Young
Ladies</i> (Miss <span class="smcap">Rutina Redtape</span> <i>and</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Minks</span>) <i>discovered. At the
counter a stout but agreeable Youth purchasing post-cards. Various
Members of General Public behind, waiting.</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Redtape</span> <i>is engaged at
the telegraphic instrument</i>.</p>

<p><i>Stout but Agreeable Youth (to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Minks</span>). Let's have another look at
the thin ones.</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks.</i> Well, you <i>are</i> a difficult one to please! (<i>With a
killing glance.</i>) <i>There!</i> Now, perhaps you'll make up your mind!</p>

<p><i>St. Y.</i> Not so difficult to please as you fancy. But I <i>am</i> a little
particular about post-cards. I write a good deal on post-cards.</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks (archly).</i> I hope you don't write your <i>secrets</i> on
post-cards!</p>

<p><i>St. Y.</i> If I do, you'll be able to read 'em, you know.</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks.</i> Do you suppose I've any time for reading rubbish?
Besides&mdash;(<i>more archly still</i>)&mdash;I don't even know your handwriting.</p>

<p><i>St. Y.</i> I write a very nice hand. You shall see it some day.</p>

<p><i>Impatient Member of Public.</i> Will you kindly tell me if this letter
will go for a penny? (<i>Pathetically.</i>) I've been waiting some time!</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks (in injured tone).</i> I can't possibly attend to more than one
at a time! (<i>To</i> Stout Youth.) You'll get me into trouble, you see, if
you're so faddy about choosing. You are so <i>silly</i> over it!</p>

<p><i>St. Y.</i> I daresay you'll think it rather odd, but I don't seem able to
make up my mind. (<i>Insinuatingly.</i>) Suppose <i>you</i> choose for me?</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks.</i> Perhaps you won't like what <i>I</i> choose?</p>

<p><i>St. Y.</i> Don't make yourself at all uneasy about <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks (coquettishly).</i> I don't. There's a packet of thick ones for
you. Now, give me eightpence, and go away.</p>

<p><i>St. Y.</i> The idea of expecting a fellow to have <i>eight</i>-pence about him!</p>

<p><i>Another Impatient Member of Public.</i> Dozen penny stamps, Miss, please.</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks.</i> If you'll <i>kindly</i> wait till I have finished with this
gentleman!</p>

<p><i>St. Y. (in undertone).</i> You <i>have</i> finished with this gentleman&mdash;done
for him completely!</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks.</i> Do you think I don't know better than to believe such
nonsense! I shall get into <i>such</i> a row for keeping these people
waiting&mdash;and it's all <i>your</i> fault. [<i>Plaintively.</i></p>

<p><i>St. Y.</i> Poor little girl&mdash;they <i>do</i> work you awfully hard! I'll go
(<i>sentimentally</i>), but I shall keep these post-cards <i>always</i>!</p>

<p><i>Miss Redtape (reading a telegram).</i> Chipperfield Lodge, Chipperfield,
near Uxbridge. Can't send that, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Author of Message.</i> Can't send it? Nonsense! Why?</p>

<p><i>Miss R. (who suffers from a fixed idea; with deliberate precision).</i>
Because it is insufficiently addressed.</p>

<p><i>A. of M. (much astonished).</i> Where on earth is the insufficiency?</p>

<p><i>Miss R.</i> "<i>Near</i> Uxbridge"&mdash;you must alter that before I can send it.</p>

<p><i>A. of M.</i> That's the address I was given; I've no reason to believe it
wants adding to, and I <i>can't</i> add anything!</p>

<p><i>Miss R.</i> Then I can't send it.</p>

<p>[A. of M. <i>remonstrates in vain, pleads, and urges</i>&mdash;Miss <span class="smcap">Rutina</span>
<i>remains obdurate, and he has to retire, helpless</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks (gabbling out form handed in by anxious-looking Lady).</i> "For
love of Heaven do nothing of kind. Come to me at once, <span class="smcap">Tiny</span>"&mdash;you want
that to go as it is?</p>

<p><i>Anx. Lady.</i> Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;there's no irregularity in it, is there?</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks (severely).</i> You know that better than I can tell you.
Limmer's? Limmer's <i>what</i>?</p>

<p><i>Anx. Lady.</i> Limmer's Hotel.</p>

<p><i>Miss Minks.</i> Then that will be another halfpenny&mdash;it will be sent off
in its proper turn.</p>

<p><i>Enter a</i> German Servant.</p>

<p><i>German Serv. (to Miss R.)</i> I vas to gif you zis delegram, blease.</p>

<p><i>Miss R.</i> Very well&mdash;you can leave it. Stop&mdash;who's it addressed to?
(<i>With much decision.</i>) <i>This</i> won't do!</p>

<p><i>Germ. Serv.</i> I vas to gif it to you. Is it not for ze Lord Meyer?</p>

<p><i>Miss R.</i> Lord Mayor, yes, I see that well enough, but <i>where</i>?</p>

<p><i>Germ. Serv.</i> I subbose vere he dwell at&mdash;I do not know how you gall
it&mdash;on ze oondergroundt I zink it is.</p>

<p><i>Miss R.</i> Don't know any Lord Mayor who lives underground&mdash;can't take it
like this.</p>

<p><i>Officious Bystander.</i> He means the Mansion House. I should think that
would find the Lord Mayor without much difficulty, wouldn't it?</p>

<p><i>Miss R. (chillingly).</i> Can't say, I'm sure. (<i>To Servant.</i>) Go back and
ask your Master if he means Mansion House, to say so.</p>

<p><i>Germ. S. (blankly).</i> He is goned avay&mdash;he vill not be pack undil

<p><i>Miss R.</i> Then ask him, <i>then</i>.</p>

<p><i>Germ. S.</i> I zink it vas imbortant&mdash;eef you gould dry at ze Mansions

<p><i>Miss R.</i> I've no authority to put in anything beyond what's given me to
send&mdash;if your Master <i>will</i> give an insufficient address, it's not my
fault, and you can tell him so.</p>

<p><i>Off. Bystander (to Miss R.)</i> But hang it all! There's only one Lord
Mayor, in London at all events!</p>

<p><i>Miss R.</i> How do I know it's for London at all?</p>

<p><i>Bystander.</i> I should have thought you might have <i>risked</i> it!</p>

<p><i>Miss R.</i> I can't help what you would have thought, Sir; I know my own
business. (<i>To Germ. S.</i>) I've given you my answer.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit</i> German Servant <i>resignedly, his idea of a Lord Mayor somewhat
lowered</i>; Miss <span class="smcap">Redtape</span> <i>stamps letters with the serenity of conscious
rectitude. Scene closes in.</i></p>

<h2>LORD'S AND LADIES. (July 8, 1887.)</h2>

<center><i>Lady loquitur</i>:&mdash;</center>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Battle</span> of Blues? There's the blue of the skies and eyes aristocratic,</p>
<p class="i0">But take the array all around the true battle is polychromatic.</p>
<p class="i0">Eh? <span class="smcap">Fair</span> <i>versus</i> <span class="smcap">Brand</span>? Ah! of course; but you cannot expect us to narrow</p>
<p class="i0">The rainbow of Fashion to favour the yearnings of Eton and Harrow.</p>
<p class="i0">Nice lads, <i>very</i> nice; always like Eton boys, when they haven't got "pots" on,</p>
<p class="i0">And there is a good deal that's "smiting" in Whatshisname&mdash;no, I mean <span class="smcap">Watson</span>;</p>
<p class="i0">But Blue's not so <i>chic</i> as it was, and a triumph in azure is barren,</p>
<p class="i0">That is, to a girl who is simply a girl, and not <span class="smcap">A. C. M'Laren</span>,</p>
<p class="i0">White has it to-day, my dear <span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, though a spotting of scarlet and crimson</p>
<p class="i0">Gleams over the ground, for sweet woman <i>will</i> take most peculiar whims on.</p>
<p class="i0">A nice bit of Chelsea? Eh? What? Oh! that plucky <i>Lord</i> <span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>, dear fellow!</p>
<p class="i0">Not out, seventy-two; very good!&mdash;but <i>do</i> look at that girl in bright yellow!</p>
<p class="i0">It seems to add heat to the sun that is beating and broiling our backs on.</p>
<p class="i0">Eh? Why doesn't <span class="smcap">Fair</span> make more use of his capital fast bowler, <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>?</p>
<p class="i0">I'm sure <i>I</i> don't know. <span class="smcap">Edith Bland</span> all alone there, poor faded forlorn flower!</p>
<p class="i0">Yes, Harrow has rather hard luck, and I wish I had mounted a cornflower;</p>
<p class="i0">But blue doesn't suit me a bit; and why <i>can't</i> they change colours with seasons,</p>
<p class="i0">These Teams? Oh! don't argue it, please, there's no muddle like male creatures' <i>reasons</i>.</p>
<p class="i0">That lady in heliotrope graceful? Dear me! why she walks like Pa's heifer,</p>
<p class="i0">Eat? Oh! it's too hot; I could lunch on a strawberry plus an iced zephyr.</p>
<p class="i0">Well, y-e-es, <i>one</i> more glass of champagne, and that salad is really delightful.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">Why <span class="smcap">Floss</span> had three helps to my two, that child's appetite really is frightful!</p>
<p class="i0">Oh! what's that? Poor <span class="smcap">Fair</span> out again? Now I think that's unfair. Oh! no pun, Sir&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">I never <i>do</i> pun, if you please, and most surely not under this sun, Sir.</p>
<p class="i0">There are too many ways, don't you think, so? of getting "out"; bowlings, and catches,</p>
<p class="i0">And stumpings, and&mdash;what's l.b.w.? Always see that in these matches&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">Oh! there is Prince <span class="smcap">Christian</span>! I <i>wish</i> that the lads had less powerful voices,</p>
<p class="i0">This shouting must hurt Harrow's feelings, and if she <i>has</i> fewer "old choices"</p>
<p class="i0">That isn't <i>her</i> fault, I suppose, and they ought to allow her more batters.</p>
<p class="i0">That would harrow poor Harrow much more? Well, I really <i>can't</i> fathom such matters.</p>
<p class="i0">Ah! <span class="smcap">Raphael</span> seems a sweet name; and he's "out for a duck" too; how horrid!</p>
<p class="i0">Why, even poor <span class="smcap">Gosling</span> made <i>four</i>. Oh, dear me, 'tis tremendously torrid!</p>
<p class="i0">And, how they <i>can</i> run so&mdash;&mdash;There, listen to <span class="smcap">Isabel Smythe</span>, <i>do</i> just listen.</p>
<p class="i0">She's coached up in Cricketing slang; she has "crammed" for it. How her eyes glisten!</p>
<p class="i0">"Oh! bowled, Sir, indeed! Caught, Sir, caught!"&mdash;And she rhymes "bowled" to "howled." Most disgusting!</p>
<p class="i0">Last over? Hope Harrow will pull up to-morrow. Of course they are trusting</p>
<p class="i0">In mighty <span class="smcap">M'Laren</span> again. But oh, if their colours they'd vary!</p>
<p class="i0">Unless you've a brother, you know, or a</p>
<p class="i0">lover like <span class="smcap">Mildred</span> and <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.</p>
<p class="i0">In one team or other, it's hard to get up an emotion that's "humming,"</p>
<p class="i0">For dark blue and light are so like, Sir, and neither is <i>very</i> becoming.</p>

<p>"<i>The Three Graces</i>," now well placed, had been previously "skied." But
didn't this show that Sir <span class="smcap">Joshua's</span> work ranked uncommonly high in the
opinion of the former hangers?</p>

<p>It is not surprising that among Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Peel's</span> Collection there
should have been several charming Constables. These Pictures ought to be

"O my dear! don't use such awful language!" then bethink you of

<h2>PAVING THE WAY FOR HIM.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is understood that at the final sitting of the Sobranje it was
decided to submit to Prince <span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span> of Saxe-Coburg the following
memorandum of terms for his acceptance:&mdash;</p>

<p>That he shall forward, together with his references, his photograph on
approval.</p>

<p>On it being notified to him that these have been considered
satisfactory, he shall state whether he understands the confidence and
three-card tricks, and also what acquaintance he possesses with the
heavier feats of advanced <i>leger-de-main</i> that would warrant his active
intervention in the diplomatic intrigues of Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>That he shall provide his own crown, which must be a decidedly showy
affair, and should be so constructed as, by a little manipulation, it
could, in any sudden outbreak of popular fury, be made to assume the
appearance of an ordinary top-hat.</p>

<p>That his coronation-robe should be reversible, and, when turned inside
out, serve as a dressing-gown that would be available for night
surprises of a revolutionary character.</p>

<p>That he should be supplied with six bullet-proof shirts, to be worn on
important State occasions, and have not less than twelve complete
theatrical disguises for purposes of escaping with his life beyond the
frontiers after the passing of unpopular measures.</p>

<p>That he will be expected to have sufficient command of the Russian
language to enable him to indite an occasional defiant and offensive
epistle to the <span class="smcap">Czar</span> as occasion may require.</p>

<p>That he must understand that his household will be composed partly of
traitors, whom, however, as the Government will see that his bedroom
door is provided with an extra bolt, he need only keep carefully under
his eye during the daytime.</p>

<p>That the salary for discharging the above functions will be &pound;200 per
annum, payable quarterly in advance, and guaranteed as recoverable by
personal service, on the properties of the unpopular chiefs of the
Opposition.</p>

<h2>OFFICIAL OBJECT LESSONS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Complaining</span> of the foul condition of the bathing-lakes in Victoria Park,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pickersgill</span> asked the First Commissioner of Works "to accompany him
one morning to see the state of the Lakes for himself." There is some
reason to believe that, acting on this admirable suggestion, official
expeditions will be organised to other places; for instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span> will attend at Covent Garden Market at two o'clock
in the morning and stay there till mid-day, and see how he likes it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span> will consent to be locked inside a barricaded Irish
hovel when an eviction is expected.</p>

<p>The Ranger of Kensington Gardens&mdash;if there is one, or, failing him, the
Deranger&mdash;will visit the neighbourhood of the Round Pond, and notice the
adroit manner in which the turf has been removed so as just to prevent
the full enjoyment of the gardens by the public during the whole of the
present summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Matthews</span>, as an Amateur and very Casual Defendant, will go round the
various Metropolitan Police-courts, and attempt to give evidence
contradicting that of policemen, and will thus obtain a valuable insight
into Magisterial deportment.</p>

<p>Selected Members of the Vestries and of the Metropolitan Board of Works
will harness themselves to omnibuses, and attempt to drag the vehicles,
when fully loaded, over watered wood and asphalte without slipping.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, disguised as a troubled parishioner in
need of spiritual advice, will call on any London Curate and ask him his
real unvarnished opinion on his Vicar's proposal that he should "give
liberally" to the Church House Scheme.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> will "take a place" in Kerry and try to collect his own
rents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Labouchere</span> will negotiate with the Sublime Porte himself, at half
Sir H. <span class="smcap">Drummond Wolff's</span> salary, and promise not to grumble.</p>

<p>And, every Member of Parliament who has ever promised to "do something"
to improve the Dwellings of the Poor, and has done nothing, will spend
the whole of August in a slum-dwelling in Whitechapel.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</center>

<h4>F.M. PUNCH'S PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW.</h4>
<h3><i>Fac-Simile of Sketch made by our Special Artist on the Field.</i></h3>
</div>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, July 4.</i>&mdash;Floor of House strewed with
crackers to-night, popping off unexpectedly as proceedings advanced.
Immediately after Questions, <span class="smcap">Arthur Balfour</span> brought up to whipping-post.
For so clever a young man <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> has made serious mistake. Gave definite
pledge upon certain clause of Coercion Bill, then omitted to fulfil it,
and finally, when challenged, wriggled about and endeavoured to show
that his remissness of no practical consequence. House doesn't like
wriggling. Nobody but <span class="smcap">Hart-Dyke</span> came to assistance of beleaguered
Minister, and <i>he</i> was incontinently put down by <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>.
<span class="smcap">Halley-Stewart</span>, that child of victory, came in fresh from Spalding.
Greeted with thunderous cheers from Opposition who have plucked up
spirits wonderfully.</p>

<p>Old Morality, in his oldest and most moral manner, moved to appropriate
remaining time of House for Government business. Fire opened upon him
from all sides in protest against arrangement. Every man with a Bill
wanted day to bring it forward. <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> in most magnificent manner
joined in protest. <span class="smcap">Smith</span> having replied in detail seemed that the
incident was closed. But in fact was only beginning. <span class="smcap">Smith</span> had greatly
shocked <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> by incidentally alluding to Opposition as "entirely
unparalleled in annals of Parliament." <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, recalling some scenes
between 1880 and 1885, raised his hands appealingly to 'igh 'eaven
against the statement. <span class="smcap">John Morley</span> dashed in with vigorous speech; then
<span class="smcap">Goschen</span> came to front, wringing his hands and working himself up to
height of desperation. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> had declared that he and his friends
had not been charged with conniving at Obstruction.</p>

<p>"If the charge has not been made," said <span class="smcap">Goschen</span>, trying to edge himself
behind the plump figure of Old Morality, "it shall be made, and I make
it."</p>

<p>This brought up <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, who called <span class="smcap">Goschen</span> "a deserter." This did not
add to general amity of proceedings. Opposition cheered; Conservatives
howled; then, amid uproar, a voice was heard denouncing the conduct of
Members of the Government as "wanting in dignity and decorum." The voice
spoke more in sorrow than in anger. There was a tear in every syllable.
It was clear that, out of the fulness of a heart crushed with pain at
witnessing these unruly proceedings, the mouth spoke. The voice not
unfamiliar. All eyes turned to the quarter whence it proceeded. Who
could it be that thus added a final reproach to a guilty and trembling
Government? Who, in accents trembling with conviction and emotion,
convicted it of "lack of decorum and dignity?"</p>

<p>It was <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis</span>!</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Government secured all remaining days of Session.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday Night.</i>&mdash;"A bad Cass, a very bad Cass," murmured Old Morality,
moving uneasily on his seat. It was Seven o'clock. Things certainly
looking very bad. At Question-time, <span class="smcap">Atherly-Jones</span>, who had been watching
the case for some time, asked the <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> whether he had made
inquiry into the Regent Street affair, and if so, what was the result?
<span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> had, from the first, blundered hopelessly. When first
questioned peremptorily refused to interfere. Then <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>
interposed and backed up claim for inquiry. <span class="smcap">Matthews</span> with ludicrous
haste knuckled down and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> gave desired promise. This was on Friday last.
Now went back from promise and declined to have anything to do with
affair. House evidently angry. <span class="smcap">Atherly-Jones</span> moved adjournment;
supported by over a hundred, and debate entered upon. <span class="smcap">Caine</span> and <span class="smcap">Dodds</span>
struggled for honour of seconding Motion. <span class="smcap">Dodds</span> won. Seems Miss <span class="smcap">Cass's</span>
father is one of his constituents and a most respectable man.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%">
<a href="images/024a.png">
<img src="images/024a.png" width="100%" alt="On the watch" /></a>
<h4>"On the watch."</h4>
</div>

<p>"Why," cried Member for Stockton with sudden access of energy, "he leads
the brass band in the Malleable Iron Works."</p>

<p>That settled it. Thenceforward <span class="smcap">Matthews</span> regarded as a doomed man.
<span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span> made speech conclusively showing innocence of Miss <span class="smcap">Cass</span>. Not
only was her father leader of the brass band, but it was clear she had
not been out of the house on the nights the policeman swore he saw her
in Regent Street. <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span> came to rescue of colleague, but
movement ineffectual. Old Morality uttered some ponderous commonplaces
without avail. <span class="smcap">Caine</span>, revelling in temporary freedom, lashed the <span class="smcap">Home
Secretary</span>. <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>, that pink of chivalry, finding his old friend and
colleague down, joyously jumped on him.</p>

<p>"I made him Home Secretary, and when I kicked over the traces of course
I expected him to resign with me. But he stuck to office and salary. I
said nothing, but I thought the more. Waited for my chance, and here it
is."</p>

<p>So <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> prodded <span class="smcap">Matthews</span> in the back, buffetted him about the head,
and made him begin to wish that he'd resigned long ago. Motion for
adjournment of House carried to a Division, and Government defeated by
Majority of Five!</p>

<p>"A bad Cass&mdash;a very bad Cass!" repeated Old Morality, as he picked up
his papers, and went off in unexpectedly good time for dinner.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Home Secretary's</span>.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry Matthews</span> spent pleasant quarter of an hour this
afternoon. <span class="smcap">Smith</span> came down, and surrendered unconditionally in the <span class="smcap">Cass</span>
case. Promised to make the inquiry which <span class="smcap">Matthews</span> had refused. <span class="smcap">John
Dillon</span> suggested that, in order to save time, Ministers should in future
make up their minds what to do before the Division was taken. <span class="smcap">Matthews</span>
said nothing. Rather sorry for him. Thought I'd cheer him up a bit.</p>

<p>"Don't take this too much to heart," I said. "Good deal of talk about it
just now, but soon be forgotten."</p>

<p>"Take what to heart?" he asked, with pretty air of surprise. "<span class="smcap">Smith</span> is
only confirming what I said when I promised an inquiry."</p>

<p>"But then you refused it afterwards."</p>

<p>"Exactly. So, if <span class="smcap">Smith</span> had come down and refused the inquiry, I would
still have been all right. Don't you see?"</p>

<p>I didn't, quite. Perhaps it will come on further reflection. <i>Business
done.</i>&mdash;Supply.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Came upon curious scene in Lobby this afternoon, just after
prayers. <span class="smcap">F. W. Maclean</span>, Member for Woodstock Division of Oxfordshire,
standing at full length near the Post-Office. To him enter <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>,
making for House, anxious to see how <span class="smcap">Matthews</span> is looking to-day.
<span class="smcap">Maclean</span>, drawing himself up another inch, looked down on <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>.
<span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>, seizing the situation, half turned round, and looked up at
his successor in the re-adjusted representation of Woodstock. Neither
spoke; but it was a pretty scene, not needing words.</p>

<h4>Past and Present Members for Woodstock.</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> found <span class="smcap">Matthews</span> on Treasury Bench, looking as if nothing had
happened, and as if nothing was going to happen. House curiously
crowded, considering. The old story over again, with just a difference
in enumeration of the chapter. Hitherto been on Coercion Bill, First
Reading, Second Reading, Committee Stage, and Report Stage. Now Third
Reading moved. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> begins it all over again, as if nothing had yet
been said. Benches filled to hear him, and no one moved till speech
ended in glowing peroration. Then Members, simultaneously struck with
conviction that they'd heard this before, streamed out. Rest of Sitting
dull talk and empty benches. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Third Reading of Coercion
Bill moved.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Coercion Bill through at last! Final bout of talking dull
till towards end, when <span class="smcap">Dillon</span> made one of his impassioned speeches
(wonderfully improved has <span class="smcap">John</span> since he first entered House). <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>
stroked Ministerialist back wrong way; and <span class="smcap">Goschen</span> replied in animated
speech. One little flash disturbed monotony of earlier part of sitting.
Elderly young man, name of <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span>, trotted out again the mean and
spiteful reference to Old Morality's Book-stall connection. O. M., for
once moved to anger, hotly resented impertinence.</p>

<p>Haven't we had enough of this now? It was <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span> began it. Not
desirable that men without a tithe of <span class="smcap">Tim's</span> talent should imitate his
ingrained ill-manners.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Coercion Bill passed by Majority of 87.</p>

<h2>SONG BY SIR ABEL HANDY.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">'Twas</span> on a summer morning in this tropical July,</p>
<p class="i0">A happy thought impelled me an experiment to try.</p>
<p class="i0">Hot early, weather promised to be more hot later on:</p>
<p class="i0">What were the highest grade the glass would register anon?</p>
<p class="i0">A delicate thermometer, the Fahrenheit, was mine;</p>
<p class="i0">I placed it in the solar-beams direct, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, at nine.</p>
<p class="i0">It shortly rose to ninety; and by ten reached twenty more;</p>
<p class="i0">Eftsoon degrees one-hundred-nine-and-twenty was the score;</p>
<p class="i0">Glass went on rising near as high as it was marked to go.</p>
<p class="i0">A hundred, three times ten, and six the highest it could show.</p>
<p class="i0"><i>Excelsior!</i> as <span class="smcap">Longfellow's</span> ascending Pilgrim cried;</p>
<p class="i0">So I began to marvel what was going to betide,</p>
<p class="i0">Expanding still the spirit rose within, ere noon had past,</p>
<p class="i0">Till bang went my thermometer, the brittle tube had brast!</p>
<p class="i0">My old and well-tried servant through ten years in hot or cold,</p>

<h4>Head of a Chapter.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bishops are considering the "Amen-Corner" Amen-ments to the
Catechism. <i>Dr. Punch</i> happening to drop into the Upper House as a cool
retreat on a July day, reminded their Lordships of the touching appeal
of <i>Little Billee</i> when he went "down upon his bended knees" to the
inhuman <i>Gorging Jack</i> and <i>Guzzling Jimmy</i>, imploring a short respite
in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"O let me say my Catechism</p>
<p class="i0">As my poor mother taught to me."</p>
</div></div>

<p>And <i>Mr. P.</i> asked the Upper House to pause before adding another burden
to the sorely tried child on a hot Sunday. Also the learned Doctor of
Divinity wished to ask why, when amending, is it considered necessary to
preserve the prim archaic style of English, which is nowadays only
associated with the strictest Quaker, and which is so suggestive of
formality and unreality? Why say "What meanest thou," and so forth? It
was Puritanical; now it is pedantic. The Bishops agreed with <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, but the Thermometer being 120&deg;, they adjourned to the "Wholly
Shade," adjoining the lawn-tennis ground.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to record how something was done in the House of Laymen.
Lord <span class="smcap">Nelson</span> said he had received a blow on the head,&mdash;from a draught.
The President wanted to know if it was a draught of a resolution? Lord
<span class="smcap">Nelson</span> explained that it wasn't. He had alluded to an air-draught. He
wished to propound the old theological question, "<i>Cur induit albam
Millerus tegulam?</i>" with its answer, "<i>Ut caput servat calidum</i>."
("<i>Hear, hear!</i>") He wished to know whether, for the reason above
mentioned, he might wear his hat. The President remarked that he thought
it would be out of order if he did. Earl <span class="smcap">Nelson</span> observed that he would
soon be out of order if he didn't, as he should have a severe cold. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Hubbard</span>, M.P., who is to be made a Peer, with the title of
Earl-y-<span class="smcap">Churchouse</span>, was understood to say that if he wasn't allowed to
wear his hat, he knew he should have a <i>gravamen</i> to-morrow. The
President then gave the required permission. Hats are now worn in the
House of Laymen.</p>
